This scripts in this directory are designed to be implemented only after specific other processes have been completed. 

Overall Image Analysis Procedure Used:

1) Cropped Pyrenoid (ROI) in each dataset image (chose one cell per picture grouping and set scale in nanometers based on magnification)

2) Trained and segmented each image using Ilastik Machine Learning (must follow naming conventions that are specified on google drive!!!)

3) ImageJ MasterScript: 

# ImageJ Implementation Sequence: 
    1) Processing_ThresholdedforSegmentedInput2.ijm
    2) FinalCode.ijm variant: forNormalization.ijm 
        Make sure that measurements are being saved to a .csv file and that the ROIManager is naming each selection 
        the image name 
    3) NormalizingIntensityMeasurments.ijm
        Make sure that measurements are being saved to a text file 
    
# Run these programs only after all of the above have been completed
